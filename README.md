## Overview

This project focuses on the task of image classification to diagnose Alzheimer's and dementia from medical MRIs. It involves a binary and a multiclass classification, with corresponding labels:

Binary:
- Healthy
- Dementia
  
Multiclass:
- healthy
- very mild dementia
- mild dementia
- moderate dementia

## Key Features/Technologies 

- Binary and multiclass classification of Alzheimer's and dementia.
- Utilization of three datasets: OASIS (https://www.oasis-brains.org/), Alzheimer-MRI-dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/legendahmed/alzheimermridataset/metadata), and ADNI (https://adni.loni.usc.edu/).
- Five pretrained CNNs: AlexNet, ResNet101, ResNet50, GoogLeNet, InceptionResNetV2.
- Fine-tuning models on different datasets for cross validation.
- MATLAB
- Transfer Learning
